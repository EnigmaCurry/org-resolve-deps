* Org resolve deps

This package will walk all the include-statements of an org-mode file
and temporarily replace them with the content of the files specified
when tangling.

** Usage

You will need to have the package on your ~load-path~. And do something
akin to:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
(require 'org-resolve-deps)
(org-resolve-deps-mode t)
#+end_src
At this point, you can now execute the command ~org-resolve-deps-tangle~
from you're root org-mode file.

*Fair warning!* This is a work in progress, so there are kinks. ATM, the
advice around the original tangling functions fail and should not be
used.
