* Org resolve deps

*Fair warning!* This package is not yet in a working state, but the idea
is that commit ~#2~ will be, so add it to you're watch list and you'll
be notified.

This package will walk all the include-statements of an org-mode file
and temporarily replace them with the content of the files specified
when tangling.

** Usage

You will need to have the package on your ~load-path~. And do something
akin to:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
(require 'org-resolve-deps)
(setq org-resolve-deps-advice t)
(org-resolve-deps-mode t)
#+end_src
That way, when you tangle as usual; includes will be resolved. If you
don't want to override the default tangling-functions of org-mode, you
can use ~org-resolve-deps-tangle~ command explicitly and leave out the
~org-resolve-deps-advice~ variable above.
